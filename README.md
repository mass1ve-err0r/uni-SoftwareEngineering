# UniBi - Software Engineering Project
The following is the source-code of the SE-Project up until 3/4th of the way.
- Not optimized in any way
- 100% Java
- 0/10 Creativity of the professor.

## Gist
It's a festify.rocks alternative, meant to be used locally.

Uses nanoHTTPD and VLCj4.

Due the project idea being "property" of the Bielefeld University, I cannot provide any furher details on improvement or additions so take this however you'd like to.

The code however is mine and anyone is free to utilise bits and pieces.
